# Data Provenance (Schema)

`syke.ebv.phenology.data-provenance` *v1.0*

Lineage and provenance information for EBV phenology datasets and derived phenology indicators.

[*Status*](http://www.opengis.net/def/status): Under development

## Description

# Data Provenance for Phenology Indicators

This Building Block documents the lineage of derived EBV phenology indicators.

The provenance example describes how national-scale annual phenology indicators were derived from the original NetCDF dataset for Finland. It records:

- source dataset metadata
- agents involved in creation, derivation and publication
- source, intermediate and derived entities
- processing activities
- methodological parameters
- quality and interpretation limitations

The provenance follows a PROV-O inspired structure using `prov:Entity`, `prov:Activity`, `prov:Agent`, `prov:used`, `prov:wasGeneratedBy`, `prov:wasAssociatedWith` and related concepts.

The example is designed to support transparency and reproducibility. It does not by itself make the derived indicators policy-grade evidence.
